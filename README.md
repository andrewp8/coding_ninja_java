# **Coding Ninja**

## Drawing inspiration from the Coding Dojo learning platform, we set out to create a lightweight learning platform that would enable access to education and learning for all. Our vision is to provide a user-friendly and affordable platform for individuals and organizations seeking to access educational resources. 

## Why Spring Boot Framework?
1.) Rapid Development: Spring Boot provides a lot of out-of-the-box functionality and pre-configured components that can speed up the development process, allowing us to focus on building the core features of our application.

2.) Easy Integration: Spring Boot makes it easy to integrate with other technologies, such as databases, messaging systems, and authentication frameworks.

3.) Security: Spring Boot provides a number of built-in security features, such as CSRF protection, authentication, and authorization.
